## Tiny blocker of Windows tracking and telemetry written in plain C++/Win32 API. Just run once as admin and forget. No questions asked. No harmful actions performed like other Windows spying blockers try.

There are many proprietary as well as open source so called "blockers" of built-in Windows spyware on the market.
They all lie you, except if you have Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC installed.

## Nobody can turn off built-in Windows spyware and telemetry sending except your Windows 10 or 11 distibution is Enterprise LTSC graded.

Enterprise LTSC means you CAN turn off built-in Windows spyware and telemetry with GUARANTEE, OFFICIALLY.
It can be done just by disabling few services and writing few values into Registry.

TinyWinSpyOff does it exactly: it turns off built-in Windows spyware and telemetry for Windows Enterprise LTSC grade installations.

## My Windows is NOT Enterprise LTSC. Does TinyWinSpyOff still work?

Yes, but partially. You can turn off built-in Windows spyware and telemetry, but without official guarantee from Microsoft.
Anonymous depersonalized telemetry will be sending anyway at "BASIC" telemetry level.
Spyware will be turned off DE FACTO.

## TinyWinSpyOff is statically linked standalone native Windows app just 500Kb in size.

Just download, run and restart your Windows. No installation required.

You have to be an Administrator of your Windows PC.
TinyWinSpyOff requires Elevation of privileges on start! If you have UAC control set by default,
Windows will warn you by so called "Unknown Publisher".
Say YES, but check the sha256 hash of the TinyWinSpyOff executable you have just downloaded.
